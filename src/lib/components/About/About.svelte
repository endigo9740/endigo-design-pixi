		<p>
			Hello and to this showcase of some of my most prominent works. I have dedicated the last 20+ years of my life to building a career in
			professional development, design, and UX. I am primarily self taught in these disciplines, but still take time to research, tinker,
			and learn more every day.
		</p>
		<p>
			I discovered my passion for programming and design while attending classes for Visual Basic and Photoshop in high school. I'm also a
			live long fan of video games. Which kicked off when I received my first console, a classic Nintendo Entertainment System as a kid. I
			still remember the magic of picking up that controller and making Mario run and jump on the screen - though occasionally to his
			untimely death.
		</p>
		<p>
			My passion has fueled a lifelong journey, culminating in a career path that includes a broad spectrum of industries, including:
			photography, corporate media, a digital agency, a number of tech startups - all before landing in my current role as the core
			maintainer for <a class="anchor" href="https://skeleton.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Skeleton</a>, a web-based UI toolkit.
			I’ve since had the privilege to work with extremely passionate and talented individuals, helping build major platforms and services
			for the web, gaming, and open source.
		</p>
		<p>
			I feel my strength lies not just in writing code or design UI, but in solving real world problems. I pride myself in my ability to
			listen, learn, and help determine what is really needed for any given challenge. Providing solutions at every step of the way, from
			concept to execution. Whether you’re trying to build a web application, engage your audience, or carve a new path in the world. My
			skills are available to help get you to where you need to be!
		</p>
